# burrito_framework

I decided to create my own framework for several reasons

1) First my current website at that time was quite ugly and I wanted to change it but without having to deploy a heavy stuff</br>
2) I had tried to do it with django framework but the result was not convincing enough for me so I decided to switch to something else</br>
3) I realised thaht I was always doing the same things in my coding and therefore losing lot of time for nothing</br>
4) I wanted to discover bash programming</br>

<strong>I) Creating a new project </strong></br>
